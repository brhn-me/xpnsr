# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE:** 2024-02-07
* **ASSISTANTS:** Iván

### Minutes
In our first meeting about the XPNSR project, we talked about important details to start our financial management API. We began with an introduction to XPNSR, explaining its role as an API in a bigger financial system. We discussed why creating this API is important and how it will help manage finances efficiently.

We then discussed the main ideas of the project. We explained key concepts and how they connect within the API, making it easy to understand the interactions between different parts.

We talked about how the API will be used. We described in detail how clients (like user interfaces) and services (like automated systems) will interact with the API. 

Prof. Ivan stressed the importance of keeping good documentation. This documentation should match the GitHub wiki and show the project's progress. He also advised that the project should remain focused on the most important parts and not become too large.



### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
 - Keep a clear and simple project description.   
 -  Clearly define and document key concepts and their connections.    
 - Regularly update the diagram to show current connections. 
 -  Provide detailed descriptions of how clients and services use the API.  
 - Ensure documentation is always up-to-date and matches the GitHub wiki.  
 - Focus the project on essential features only.





## Meeting 2.
* **DATE:**  2024-02-21
* **ASSISTANTS:** Iván

### Minutes
In our second meeting about the XPNSR project, we focused on the database implementation. We discussed the different database tables we will use and explained the columns for each table. We made sure to choose the right types and restrictions for each column. We also talked about the database diagram, which includes all the tables and shows their relationships clearly.

We then looked at the database models. We confirmed that all the models in our implementation match the tables in the project wiki. This means we used the correct column types and set the necessary restrictions. We also made sure that the relationships between tables are set correctly in the models, matching the foreign key relations in the diagram. We specified the `ONDELETE` behavior for each relation and implemented it correctly.

Prof. Ivan pointed out that some important elements are missing from our assessment criteria. Specifically, we need clear documentation of the database models and relationships. He also mentioned that some diagrams are missing. He encouraged us to address these issues and promised to deliver the missing parts by the next meeting.

### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
1.  Ensure all database tables are correctly defined with proper column types and restrictions.
2.  Complete the database diagram with all tables and relationships.
3.  Make sure database models match the design in the project wiki.
4.  Set and implement `ONDELETE` behavior for all relationships.
5.  Update the README file with dependency information and setup instructions.
6.  Provide clear documentation of database models and relationships.
7.  Include all missing diagrams in the documentation.



## Meeting 3.
* **DATE:** 2024-03-25
* **ASSISTANTS:** Mika

### Minutes
In our third meeting about the XPNSR project, we discussed several important aspects related to our API and its documentation. We focused on the Wiki Report, ensuring that our resource table is complete and clearly shows all available URIs and supported methods. We reviewed how addressability is achieved in our API, ensuring a consistent hierarchy of resources, and discussed how each HTTP method is used, providing examples to demonstrate a uniform interface. Additionally, we confirmed our understanding and implementation of statelessness in the API, explaining how server-side state is managed.

We also examined the basic implementation of the project. We noted that our project repository has a good structure and that the code quality is high. The README file in the project root contains full instructions on how to install, deploy the API.

Prof. Ivan emphasized the importance of implementing different API methods and ensuring proper documentation is related to these methods. He also pointed out that we need to include URL converters and schema validation, explaining their absence or usage for each URL variable and incoming request. Caching should be implemented for relevant GET methods with a clear explanation of our caching decisions and cache invalidation. 

### Action points
1.  Complete the resource table in the Wiki Report, showing all URIs and supported methods.
2.  Ensure the API is fully addressable with a consistent hierarchy of resources.
3.  Provide examples to demonstrate a uniform interface for HTTP methods.
4.  Confirm and document the statelessness of the API.
5.  Maintain good project structure and high code quality.
6.  Ensure all necessary documentation is in place and clearly marked.
7.  Update the README file with complete instructions for installation, deployment, and testing.
8.  Implement PUT, DELETE, and other API methods with proper documentation.
9.  Include and justify the use of URL converters and schema validation.
10.  Implement caching for relevant GET methods and explain caching decisions.
11.  Apply authentication to at least one resource and justify its use for each resource and method.
